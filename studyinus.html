        <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Assess Your Eligibility:</u></p>
        
        <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Check if you meet the basic requirements to study in the US. This typically includes having a high school certificate (KCSE, A-levels), proficiency in English (You will need to take the TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo test), and the financial capacity to cover tuition and living expenses. <a href="financeuni.html">Our page on on financial options</a> covers this.</p>

        <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Standardized Testing:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Many US colleges require SAT or ACT scores for admission but some are test optional.

      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Research US Colleges and Universities:</u></p>
      
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Look for colleges and universities that offer programs aligned with your interests and career goals. Consider factors like location, size, coursed (commonly called majors) offered, and available financial aid.
</p>
      
      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Prepare Necessary Documents:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Organize essential documents such as transcripts (this is a document from your school with all the classes taken and grades aquired each year), recommendation letters from your principal, standardized test scores, and any other certificates required for the application process.</p>

      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Find Suitable College Application Platforms:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">There are multiple platforms where you can apply to US colleges, such as the Common Application or Scoir.

      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Make a timeline for completing all the necessary application steps and adhere to deadlines strictly.

      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Stay Positive and Persevere:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">The process of applying to US colleges can be challenging, but don't get discouraged. Stay positive and keep working hard to achieve your goals.
