        <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Introduction</u></p>
        
        <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Internships can be a significant career stepping stone as you start your journey after high school. Even though you might run into obstacles, they shouldn't prevent you from getting internships. This guide will explain what internships are, how to find them, increase your chances of being chosen, and give important advice tailored specifically to the needs of low-income people.</p>

        <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>1. Getting to Know Internships:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Internships provide structured learning opportunities that give undergraduates and recent high school grads the chance to develop practical knowledge and skills in a given field or industry. They can be paid or unpaid and are frequently short-term commitments. Internships provide beneficial chances to enhance your resume, network with professionals in the field, and investigate potential career paths.</p>
      
      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>2. Finding Internship Possibilities</u></p>
      
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">It's crucial to focus on internships that align with your interests.  Start by looking into local businesses, nonprofits, and governmental organisations that offer internships. Make sure to ask about these opportunities as many community-based programmes and initiatives offer internships specifically for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
</p>
      
      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>3. Make use of career networks and services:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Utilise the resources that are at your disposal such as through local organisations. This source might be able to connect you with organisations that provide internships and guide you towards suitable opportunities.</p>

      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>4. Virtual and remote internships:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Remote and virtual internships are more common in the digital age. You can take advantage of these opportunities to work from home or the neighbourhood library, saving money on expensive commutes. Look for online internships that can work with your budget.</p>
     
      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>5. Grants and Financial Assistance:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">Don't be afraid to ask about funding for internships. Some businesses and organisations provide stipends or travel grants to assist in covering your costs while you are an intern. There may also be scholarship programmes created especially for low-income students interested in internships.</p>

      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>6. Improvement of the CV and cover letter:</u></p>
      <p class="resources-page-small-text-class">On your resume, emphasise your academic success and extracurricular activities. Make sure to emphasise in your cover letter how passionate you are about the field and how eager you are to learn. Display any transferable skills you have acquired as well.

      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>7. Preparing for an interview:</u></p>

To increase your confidence, practise common interview questions with a friend. Showcase your drive and work ethic while highlighting your desire to learn and contribute to the company.
</p>

      <p class="resources-page-text-class"><u>Conclusion</u></p>

Remember that internships offer you the chance to gain valuable skills, broaden your network, and advance your professional and personal development in addition to serving as a stepping stone to your future career.</p>
