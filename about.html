      <div id="about-div-text-id">
        <p id="about-text-id">Allearn was created as a result of the flaws in the current environment of Kenyan
          educational websites. We observed that many current platforms were hampered by unsatisfactory design,
          constrictive paywalls, outdated information and a visible disregard for the needs of economically
          disadvantaged people. This reality highlighted the need to create a platform that would be truly inclusive,
          accessible, and equitable for all students.
          <br><br>
          Our dedication to addressing these problems motivates us to build a carefully constructed website that
          challenges the conventional style offered by other Kenyan resources. Allearn strongly believe that access to a
          quality education and career-resources should not be a privilege reserved for the wealthy but rather an
          essential for all. We want to level the playing field and give all high school students and graduated in Kenya
          the tools they need to achieve their goals by providing complete materials at no cost.
          <br><br>
          <b>Why the name "Allearn"?</b> The word "Allearn" combines two key elements that best describe what we do. "Al"
          stands for "all," showing our commitment to helping every deserving student, regardless of their
          circumstances or background. "Learn" highlights our main focus on education while recognising its influence in
          people's lives and communities.
          <br><br>
          At Allearn, we are aware of the importance of education. We carefully select a variety of tools, such as
          mentorship programmes, career advice, skill-building modules, and scholarships, to meet the needs and goals of
          students from low-income families.
          <br><br>
          Our Vision:
          In the future, we hope to see every student in Kenya, regardless of their financial situation, having the
          opportunity to pursue post-high school education and unlock their full potential. By equipping these young
          minds with knowledge, skills, and guidance, we aspire to pave the way for a more educated, innovative, and
          prosperous community.
